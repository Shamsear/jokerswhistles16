# Round of 16 Seeding Guide

## How It Works

After all pool matches are completed, the system automatically ranks all players in each pool based on:

1. **Points** (3 points per win)
2. **Goal Difference** (goals scored - goals conceded)
3. **Total Goals Scored** (tiebreaker)

## Automatic Matchups

The Round of 16 matchups are **automatically generated** with the following seeding:

```
ROUND OF 16 - SEEDING
═══════════════════════════════════════

Match 1:  🥇 1st Place    vs    16th Place
Match 2:  🥈 2nd Place    vs    15th Place
Match 3:  🥉 3rd Place    vs    14th Place
Match 4:     4th Place    vs    13th Place
Match 5:     5th Place    vs    12th Place
Match 6:     6th Place    vs    11th Place
Match 7:     7th Place    vs    10th Place
Match 8:     8th Place    vs    9th Place
```

## Example

If Pool A final standings are:

1. Player A (18 pts, +12 GD)
2. Player B (15 pts, +8 GD)
3. Player C (15 pts, +6 GD)
...
14. Player N (6 pts, -5 GD)
15. Player O (3 pts, -8 GD)
16. Player P (3 pts, -10 GD)

Then the Round of 16 will be:

```
Match 1: Player A  vs  Player P
Match 2: Player B  vs  Player O
Match 3: Player C  vs  Player N
...
```

## Both Pools

This seeding happens **independently** for both Pool A and Pool B:

- **Pool A**: Top 16 → 8 Round of 16 matches
- **Pool B**: Top 16 → 8 Round of 16 matches

Total: **16 matches** in Round of 16
