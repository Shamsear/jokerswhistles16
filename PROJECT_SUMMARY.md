## 🎪 Tournament System

### 6-Phase Tournament Flow

#### Phase 1: Player Registration
- **Purpose**: Collect all tournament participants
- **Methods**: 
  - Bulk upload (admin)
  - Registration links (shareable)
  - Individual registration (player self-service)
- **Features**: Token validation, duplicate prevention, email capture

#### Phase 2: Opponent Draw
- **Purpose**: Assign 8 random opponents to each player
- **Algorithm**: Fisher-Yates shuffle for fair randomization
- **Output**: 8 match fixtures per player across 8 rounds
- **Validation**: No duplicate match pairings

#### Phase 3: Home/Away Assignment
- **Purpose**: Determine match venue roles
- **Method**: Random assignment with fair distribution
- **Result**: Each match has designated home and away players

#### Phase 4: Task Pool Creation
- **Purpose**: Build task library for match conditions
- **Types**: 
  - Positive tasks (benefits)
  - Negative tasks (challenges)
- **Management**: Admin creates, edits, deletes tasks

#### Phase 5: Round-Based Task Assignment
- **Purpose**: Assign unique tasks to players per match
- **Process**: 
  - Round-by-round assignment
  - One task per player per match
  - Previous tasks excluded for same player
  - Other players can receive same tasks
- **Interface**: Spinning wheel animation

#### Phase 6: Match Execution & Results
- **Purpose**: Track match outcomes
- **Features**: 
  - View assigned tasks
  - Offline match play
  - Result reporting (in development)
  - Score tracking

## 💾 Database Schema

### Core Tables
1. **Tournaments**: Tournament metadata and phase tracking
2. **Players**: Participant information and authentication
3. **Matches**: Match fixtures with home/away assignments
4. **Tasks**: Task pool with type classification
5. **TaskAssignments**: Player-specific task allocations
6. **RegistrationLinks**: Shareable registration tokens
7. **SpinResults**: Audit trail for spin animations

### Relationships
